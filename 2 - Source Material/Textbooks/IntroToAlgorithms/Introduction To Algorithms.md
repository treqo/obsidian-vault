# VI – Graph Algorithms

````ad-note
title: Pseudo Code Notation
$G = (V,E)$ : A graph is represented by $G$, which includes a set of vertices, $V$ and a set of edges, between vertices $E$.

1. **Adjacency List**: Much more compact way to represent a **sparse** graph (i.e. a graph with $|E| < |V|^2$)

2. **Adjacency Matrix**: Could be better for dense graphs where $|E| > |V|^2$, or when you want to quickly tell if there is an edge between two vertices.
