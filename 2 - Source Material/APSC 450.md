## Fallacies & Cognitive Bias Presentation

Two thinking systems
1. Short and fast decision making 
	1. heuristics -> mental short cuts
	2. cognitive bias
2. Thorough logical
Types of heuristics
- availability
- affect

when a heuristic is wrong, it is a cognitive bias

Cognitive bias (CB)“is a systematic mismatch between heuristic  
decision rule and the decision context” (Holbrook, 2018, as  
referenced by Insight 2021).

Our decision-making processes are vulnerable to cognitive biases that  
can cloud our ethical decision-making.

## Week 7 – Essay

````ad-summary
title: Essay Prompt

**Topic J:**

Is it the bad behaviours of individuals and/or is it working environments that lead to accidents (e.g., Elliott Lake Mall collapse, Kansas City Hyatt Regency collapse, etc.)?

**Restrictrions**
500 word persuasive essay
1. take a position and start your essay with your claim
2. Then provide your reasons and evidence
3. Audience is 4th year academic level. Avoid jargon or a political piece

```ad-tip
title: Strong Essay
For a **strong essay**, you need to acknowledge and refute another author's (scientist, academic, engineer, etc) position. I used the simple claim "The sky is blue", and in my 2nd paragraph I acknowledged then refuted Smith's belief that the sky is red. Then brought my second paragraph back to my position that "the sky is blue".
```

```ad-tip
title: Bread Crumbs
Besides content, it's all about leaving 'bread crumbs for the reader" so they don't get lost in your paper such as transition words, clear and concise heading, repeating a part of your claim in P2 & P3, repetition of keywords, formatting of three paragraphs, etc. So, when in the editing phase of your essay, think about the bread crumbs.
```

```ad-tip
title: Getting Started
Lastly, to get the writing juices flowing start off by examining the question, statement etc. we gave you.

Like my autonomous vehicle question example, question the words in the question ('set of rules', 'best', fatal, etc.) in order to help you determine a position you would like to take. Then search the question itself, etc. and what kind of sources pop up in your search. Are there any sources in the course that may be helpful?

```ad-tip
title: Tips
1. When challenging a component of your essay topic question or the question itself you should consider putting the question, or a part of, or a variation of the question into your essay.

- E.g., **Does the EGBC code of ethics properly address corruption?**  
- P1: EGBC code of ethics (the Code) does not properly address corruption because X1.
- P2: The Code also does not properly address corruption because X2.
- P3: The Code also does not properly address corruption because X3.

	You get the point. I have simplified this a bit.

2. If appropriate, consider definitions to help guide your reader by setting the parameters of your paper. 

- E.g., **Is it negligent to release this app without proper consultation?**
- What is your definition of negligent? Clarify the term for your reader so that you both are on the same page. 
- You don't have to do this for any or all of your words in your question, but in this case it would be wise to perhaps define what negligent means.
- E.g., **Does the EGBC code of ethics properly address corruption?**  
    - Again, what does properly mean?
    - You may just want to create your stance around just this word.

3. One last thing!

- Some of the case studies may have sources older than 10 years. That is okay. Sometimes we can't find quality sources that have been written on a case in the last ten years. With older sources, I  double check their quality and/or if they have been acknowledged or refuted by others in the field.

Essay Formatting  
• Word .doc or .docx only.  
• Use 12-point font only.  
• Use Times New Roman font style only.  
• Page margins 2.54cm.  
• Add page numbers.  
• No title page required.  
• Minimum .5 point deduction per error.

Essay Formatting  
• Three paragraphs.  
• Example:  
• 1st paragraph: Claim, Reason, Evidence, Concluding sentence or two.  
• 2nd paragraph: Part of claim, 2nd Reason, Evidence, Counterclaim/Refute, Concluding  
sentence or two  
• Please note: You can put your counterclaim/refute in either the three paragraphs, but I  
recommend the 2nd. Why? If you don't refute the counterclaim correctly in the 3rd paragraph  
you could plant a seed of doubt in regard to your position; thereby leaving the reader  
wondering about the opposing position, and not yours. As a result, you may be less  
persuasive in regard to your argument.  
• 3rd paragraph: Part of claim, 3rd Reason, Evidence, Concluding sentence or two.  
• See below example for lay-out.  
Note: A 500 word essay is too short to have an introduction and conclusion paragraphs. You are  
writing a persuasive piece; therefore, it needs to be clear, concise and to the point, and backed up  
with credible evidence. Convince us.

It is clear that working environments, rather than individual behaviors, are the primary cause of accidents in engineering. One key factor supporting this claim is the systemic failures found in many organizations. For example, the collapse of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Walkway in 1981 was due to poor communication, ineffective oversight, and mismanagement within the project’s engineering team, not individual misconduct (Petroski, 2014). The design change that led to the structural failure was approved without a thorough review of its impact, largely because of organizational pressure to meet deadlines and stay on budget. This failure to provide adequate safety checks, combined with the pressure on engineers to prioritize cost and time over quality, stems from poorly structured organizational processes, not isolated bad actors. Moreover, research has shown that companies with weak safety cultures are significantly more prone to accidents (Jones & Smith, 2019). On the other hand, organizations that make safety a core priority see fewer incidents, even when human error occurs. Therefore, it is evident that improving working environments is crucial for reducing engineering failures.

Despite this, some argue that individual negligence plays a significant role in accidents, pointing to cases where engineers have ignored safety protocols or cut corners to meet personal or project goals. Proponents of this view suggest that human error is often the direct cause of accidents, making individual responsibility a critical focus. However, this argument fails to consider how individual actions are shaped by broader systemic issues within an organization. For instance, in the 2012 Elliot Lake Mall collapse, while certain engineers failed to report clear structural risks, the working environment discouraged transparency and allowed negligence to persist unchecked (Nelsen, 2021). This case demonstrates how a lack of organizational oversight and a culture of non-accountability can lead to failures, even when potential dangers are known. According to Howard (2020), environments where whistleblowing is discouraged or punished foster conditions that allow poor behaviors to go uncorrected, increasing the risk of accidents. While individual negligence can certainly contribute to accidents, it is the organizational context that ultimately shapes these behaviors. Therefore, addressing systemic issues is far more effective in preventing accidents than merely focusing on individual mistakes.

Another reason why working environments are more influential than individual behaviors is the role of organizational policies and leadership in shaping employee actions and decision-making processes. Studies on safety cultures in engineering firms have consistently shown that strong safety policies, regular training, and management accountability can significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents (Lenny, 2019). When organizations fail to establish clear safety standards or provide adequate training, even well-intentioned employees can make dangerous errors that lead to catastrophic outcomes. Furthermore, implementing and enforcing stringent safety regulations has been proven to prevent many potential accidents that might otherwise occur due to human error (Smith, 2020). By focusing on creating a culture that prioritizes safety, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with human fallibility. Thus, addressing systemic flaws such as poor safety policies, insufficient training programs, and weak leadership accountability is essential in reducing accidents. Ultimately, improving working environments, rather than placing undue blame on individuals, fosters safer decision-making and reduces accidents across the engineering field.
