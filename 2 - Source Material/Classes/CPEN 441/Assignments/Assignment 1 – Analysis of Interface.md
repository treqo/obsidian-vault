## I. Describe: Select an interface for analysis that has user interface problems 

The interface I will select is workday, specifically the interface that is used for UBC.

**Describe** the user experience resulting from interacting with the device.

The overall user experience is not a pleasant one. This is the common consensus gathered from student responses (reddit for example). The two most common modes of access are through the workday app, as well as the computer web page. In either case there are crucial design and functionality flaws which render the experience to be unpleasant amongst users.

(a) The interface should:

- [x] Connect a user to an electronic or digital component (our course is about human _computer_ interaction). *Since the workday platform is accessed via an app or web page this checks out*
- [x] The interface should have a graphical user interface (GUI) — that is, utilize a desktop computer and/or graphic display but can be a hand-held device, a computer application and so forth. *The interface does use GUI*

(b) Have at least 3 significant user interface **(UI)** usability problems and at **least 2 significant functionality** issues (i.e. categorize the problems into whether they are about usability or usefulness)

Does not display grade averages

When registering for courses, there is no GUI assistance to visualize how courses interact with your other courses (i.e. no timetable feature). Makes choosing courses incredible hard and inconvenient. A google chrome extension was made just to add support to this.

Presentation of course information is frustrating and inconvenient.

Course schedule viewing sucks

## II. Analyze: Determine current functionality, users and their needs

1. **List the functionality of your interface.**  
    Report the primary functions that the interface currently makes possible; describe these functions and how they are accessed.
```ad-abstract
title: primary functionalities
workday currently makes it possible, and has functionality for
- registering for courses
- viewing course information (location, time, etc.)
- viewing course grades
- other features like financials, and personal info
```
    
2. **List and Describe the users.**  
    Who are the intended users of the interface and how does the current system impact them?
    
3. **List main functional and non-functional requirements.**  
    To the best of your knowledge describe the constraints on and requirements for the system. These might include necessary response times, the consequences of various types of errors and how they should be dealt with, and other requirements relating to the tasks your interface supports. In S/W engineering terms, these are the functional and non-functional requirements for the specific elements that are important for the problems you are identifying. Your text provides some categories of requirements that can assist here.  
    
4. Compile a list of usability and user experience goals that will be most appropriate for evaluating the device based on your reading of chapter 1 and the lecture materials thus far. Indicate clearly which are most important and why.  
    
5. Translate the goals from above to three specific usability and two functionality user experience questions about these types of user interfaces that you list. Then, using these questions to evaluate your interface, describe how well the current interface does with attention paid to the 3 significant usability and 2 functionality problems that you find. Note that the questions should have objective ways to measure and evaluate successful solutions. So, for example, a question like, "Is the interface intuitive to use?" will be quite difficult to evaluate versus a question like, "Can a novice user properly enter the date in less then 20 seconds?".  
    
6. **Describe the 3 significant user interface usability problems with GUI.**  
    List the three significant user interface problems with the interface in its present form. Lecture 1b and The Design of Everyday Things provide some common concepts that can guide your search and help organize what types of problems to look for.
7. **Describe the 2 significant usefullness problems with the GUI.**  
    List the two significant usefulness problems with the interface in its present form. Link the problems you find to identified stakeholders and provide rationale for them.
