# Notes

```ad-summary
title: Summary
This video is a discussion between Robert Rosenkranz and __ on the existence of the afterlife. The question is, what happens after death? 
```

Imagine a fetus in a mothers womb, almost ready to be born, 

Is there something that we can't imagine, we can't understand, but really occurs.

Take it away from purely faith, and look at it from science.

Since **cannot** see heaven. Does that mean heaven is not as real as something we can see like a hammer?

## Round 1

**Eben Alexander**
He believed the brain creates mind and consciousness, no free will, etc.

Had a severe sickness where he was effectively brain dead for 7 days of earth time.

A flaw with our model of consciousness. This experience couldn't have happened in the brain. 

Wrote down all his experiences immediately after. Memories don't feed.

**Sean Carroll**
Human beings are not perfectly rational. Humans are very biased to the point where they can fabricate things.

Souls persisting in the afterlife, sometimes they talk to us, sometimes they don't.

The stories from life after death

mind body dualism

**Thoughts**

How about hallucinogens (shrooms, LSD) – We observe one thing but was this real?

What is "real"?

His brain was way too sick to generate anything

There is no solid evidence for when the event occurred

Time is a construct of the mind, his mind was unwell so maybe his NDE was created at active times of his brain.

58:00 "it could be real argument"

not knowing the evidence of the mechanism in the brain that forms consciousness

On the basis of philosophy, suppose there is a life after death. Would that not be the ultimate punishment?

1:17:00

Such a bold claim, to be more believable, should have an overwhelming amount of evidence to be more widely accepted.

1;23;00

quantum mechanics tied to consciousness -> physics and math have a "hole"

1;35;00

I trust peoples judgement
