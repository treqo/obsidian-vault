title: Five Essential Tasks in Software Engineering

1. **Specification / Requirements**

A **software specification** is a description of a software system to be developed â€“ Lays out *functional* and *non-functional* requirements.

**Requirements engineering** is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements. This includes requirements elicitation, analysis and negotiation, validation and management.

2. **Design**

Serves as a guide for the development team for the software product.

Some different aspects of design:
- Architectural
- Interface
- Data structure
- Algorithm
- etc.

3. **Implementation**

Converting the software design into an executable system.

The aim is to have a design, and create an implementation that allows for the following fundamental principles in the end-product:
- Efficiency/performance
- Robustness
- Usability
- Maintainability

4. **Verification & Validation**

Validation and Verification shows that a system *conforms* to its specification and meets the requirements of the customer.

**Verification**: are we building the product right? (i.e. does the software meet the **specifications**)

**Validation**: are we building the right product? (i.e. does the specification capture the customer's needs)

5. **Maintenance & Evolution**

The *modification* of a software product after delivery.

For main types of tasks:
- Corrective: fixing errors
- Perfective: implementing new or changed user requirements
- Adaptive: modifying the system to cope with changes in the environment
- Preventive: increasing software maintainability or reliability.

title: Software Process
A process defines *who* is doing *what*, *when*, and *how* in the development of a software system.

Many different software development process models.

**No Planning**
- **Code-and-fix**: write code, fix it when it breaks.

**Sequential**
- **Waterfall**: perform each phase in order

**Iterative**
- **Staged Delivery**: waterfall-like beginnings, then, short release cycle.
- **Evolutionary Prototyping**: develop a skeleton system and evolve it for delivery.
- **Spiral**: figure out *riskiest* things first
- **Agile**: a family of principles promoting adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery and continuous imrovement
	- Most popular: **Scrum** and **Kanban**
