## Personal Insights
- Change is difficult and painful; we want to stay comfortable, it's human nature. But the successful, the geniuses, the role models defy comfort, social norms and strive for greatness. A place where many dream of going, but never reach. Because it's not a path you must follow, it's the person you must become.
- Break the cycle. **Embody greatness**.
