*use the `sizeof` function to determine how many bytes a type is*

```cpp
void increment() { 
	int v[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; 
	
	for (auto& x : v) ++x; // auto &x uses the actual elements, not a copy of the element
	
	for (auto x : v) std::cout << x << " "; 
	// result is {1,2,3...}
}
```
