# About OS161

```ad-summary
title: What is OS161?
OS161 is an **educational operating system** developed at Harvard by [David Holland](https://hds.harvard.edu/people/david-f-holland). In essence, it is a simple, relatively easy to handle skeleton code base for an OS which is widely used across many universities when teaching about Operating Systems.
```
# Booting up

```ad-summary
title: Build OS161
The following gives a quick run-down of how to build OS161. It follows the convention 
1. OS161 is being worked on in a directory `~/os161` 
2. OS161 source code base is `~/os161/src`
```

### Configure the tree

First we need to run the `configure` script 

```sh
cd ~/os161/src
./configure --ostree=$HOME/os161/root
```

````ad-tip
run the following at the top level of the `src` tree to get a list of options
```sh
./configure --help
```
Running this will yield the following message
```sh
Usage: ./configure [options]
  where the options are:
    --help               Print this message.

    --debug              Compile the user-level programs with debug info.
                         This is disabled by default because there's no
                         support for userlevel source debugging in OS/161.
                         (Note: debug info in the kernel is controlled by
                         the kernel config file.)

    --ostree=PATH        Install the compiled system in a directory tree
                         rooted at PATH. Default is $HOME/os161/root.
```
````


#### Extra Info

Below is some extra info to see exactly how configure script works.

```ad-note
title: Notes on configure
- Configure script builds OS161 tree
- 
```


```sh
#!/bin/sh
#
# Configure script for OS/161 tree.
# This generates the file "defs.mk" at the top level of the tree.
#
# Usage: ./configure [options]
#   where you can get a list of the options by doing ./configure --help.
#
# Must be run with the top of the OS/161 tree as its current directory.
#
# Note: while this superficially acts like a GNU Autoconf configure
# script, it was not generated by autoconf. Scripts generated by
# autoconf are much harder to read. :-)
#
# If this script bombs out, you can create defs.mk by hand based on
# the comments in mk/os161.config.mk.
#

# Target hardware platform and machine type.
PLATFORM='sys161'
MACHINE='mips'

# Default optimize/debug flag: optimize.
DEBUG='-O2'

# Default location of the root of the installed system.
# Note that we quote it such that the reference to the home directory
# is a make variable, not a shell variable. This means it gets expanded
# when make runs rather than when this script runs.
OSTREE='$(HOME)/os161/root'

# Assume this
HOST_CC=gcc
